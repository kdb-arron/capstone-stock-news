Project Proposal (1-2 Hours)
Step Two is all about fleshing out your project idea. For this step, please write a proposal based
on the project idea you agreed on with your mentor. This proposal should be a 1-2 page
document that answers the following questions:


1.	What tech stack will you use for your final project? You will use React as the
primary framework for this project.
    a.	For the final project, I will use the following technologies:
        i.	Front-end: React (primary framework) for building the user interface.
        ii. Database: Local Storage for storing user information such as profiles, favorite stocks, and comments.
        iii.API: The external API from https://stocknewsapi.com/ will provide real-time stock news, and possibly the Yahoo Finance API for stock prices and technical analysis data.
        iv.	CSS: Bootstrap for styling the user interface.

2.	How will you design your front-end UI?
    a.	The front-end UI will mimic a social media-style feed:
        i.	News Feed Layout: Similar to Twitter(X), the primary section will be a vertical feed where users can view news articles associated with stock tickers.
        ii.	Responsive Design: The app will be fully responsive to ensure a seamless experience on desktops.
        iii.Stock Search Bar: A prominent stock ticker search bar at the top, allowing users to quickly look up specific stocks.
        iv.	User Profile Section: Users will have profiles with their tracked stocks, posts, and engagement history.
        v.	Dark Mode: A user preference for toggling between light and dark mode for better readability.
        
3.	What kind of website or web app do you want to build?
    a.	This project will be a web app designed to allow users to engage with real-time stock-related news and analyze trends. Users will be able to comment on news articles, share their insights on stock performance, and upload oscillator charts showing their technical analysis.

4.	What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
    a.	The goal of this project is to create a platform that allows day traders, investors, and financial enthusiasts to access stock-related news and trends in a social media-style environment. By allowing users to comment and share insights, the app encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing around stocks. It aims to bridge the gap between real-time financial news and user-driven analysis.

5.	What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
    a.	The primary users of this app will include:
        i.	Day Traders: Looking for quick news and trends to make fast, informed decisions.
        ii.	Financial Enthusiasts: Individuals who are passionate about the stock market and enjoy analyzing stock news and performance trends.
        iii.Investors: Long-term investors who want to track news about stocks they hold or are considering.
        iv.	General Public: People interested in learning more about how stock market news influences prices.
    b.	The demographic will mostly be adults, from young professionals (ages 20-40) to experienced investors, both male and female.

6.	What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
    a.	Data Source: The main source of data will be the external StockNews API, which provides up-to-date news articles on various stock tickers.
    b.	Stock Prices: A second API such as the Yahoo Finance API can be used for real-time stock price data and historical charts.
    c.	User Data: User-generated content (e.g., comments, uploaded analysis charts) will be stored in localstorage.

7.	In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later).

    Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information:

        a.	What kinds of issues might you run into with your API?
            i.	API Issues: I may run into issues with API rate limits or delays in fetching real-time data. To handle this, I will implement caching strategies to store previous responses temporarily and reduce the frequency of API calls.
        
        b.	Is there any sensitive information you need to secure?
            i.	Sensitive Information: The app will collect user information such as email addresses and user-generated content. I could use JSON Web Tokens to handle authentication securely, and sensitive data.
        
        c.	What functionality will your app include?
            i.	User Registration and Login: Users can create profiles to track stocks, comment on articles, and upload analysis charts.
            ii.	News Feed: Real-time news articles will populate based on selected stock tickers, allowing users to comment and share insights.
            iii.User Engagement: Users can like, comment, and share their opinions on specific articles and stock trends.

        d.	What will the user flow look like?
            i.	Homepage: Users land on a homepage that showcases trending stocks and news headlines.
            ii.	Search/Explore: Users can search for specific stocks, view related news, and analyze charts.
            iii.Stock Page: For a selected stock ticker, users will see news headlines, stock performance, user comments, and technical analysis data.
            iv.	User Profile: Users can view their favorite stocks, past comments, and uploaded charts.

        e.	What features make your site more than a CRUD app? What are your stretch goals?
            i.	Custom Alerts: Allow users to set alerts for specific stock price changes or news headlines.
            ii.	Social Sharing: Users can share news articles and their analysis on external social media platforms like Twitter or Reddit.
